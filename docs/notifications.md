# Notifications

## As any user

I can snooze my email notifications:
- for a predefined period of time (day/week/month)
- until a certain date
- indefinitely


## As Secretariat

I can send notification and reminders
- to all active users
- to all active users from one Party
- to a list of users, manually selected


# Type of notifications:

TODO

# WIP

- Submissions marked with the provisional flag are processed by the OS like any other submission
	- if an uncompliance is seen, they are notified
	- probably involves some special reminders that final data should be reported eventually
