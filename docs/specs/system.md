The Online reporting System should:

* be web-based
* store data in a relational database
* store documents/attachments as files on the local disk
* provide change history (who and when has performed each change or action), at row and field level whenever possible.
* manage concurrent changes, to prevent data loss.
* integrate with the Ozone Secretariat website single sign-on and similar look & feel.
* be deployed on a Linux server provided by UNEP; TODO: more details (technical constraints) and proposed sizing
