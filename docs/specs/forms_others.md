# Forms for non-article 7 reporting


## 1. Transfer or addition of production or consumption

### 1.1 Existing tables in the current database:

* Letters
* ProdTransfers
* ProdTransfersLetters

### 1.2 Parties to complete these forms

* Transfer of production: any party; both parties involved 
* Transfer of consumption: non-article 5 parties; both parties involved

### 1.3 Frequency of reporting

Reported whenever such a transfer/addition happens.
The period for which the transfer applies should be stated.

### 1.4 Structure

The product transfer forms should allow new product transfers to be created by the Ozone Secretariat as needed and associated with the relevant letters, which are stored in a separate Database table.

Each product transfer form should have the following fields:

* Letter - multiple choice field; mandatory; references a Letters table; each transfer can have multiple letters
* Substance - multiple choice field; mandatory; references a Substances table
* Period - multiple choice field; mandatory; references a Periods table
* Originating Country - multiple choice field; mandatory; references a Countries table
* Destination Country - multiple choice field; mandatory; references a Countries table
* Transfer quantity - numerical value in metric tons; mandatory
* Production Transfer Used - numerical value in metric tons; not mandatory
* Is Basic Domestic Need? - True/False; not mandatory
* Remarks - free form text field; not mandatory

For each registered product transfer, the OS should be able to associate the relevant transfer letter(s) (each transfer may be documented by both the originating and the destination country).

Notes:
* annex and group, present in the current data tables, will be stored separately in the substances table, per substance
