		<h1>Instructions on data on production under the exemption for high-ambient-temperature parties (data form 8)</h1>

		<p>
			Very few countries listed in Appendix II of decision XXVIII/2 have production facilities for Annex F substances (HFCs). If your country formally notified the Secretariat, as specified under paragraph 29 of decision XXVIII/2, of its intention to use the exemption for high-ambient-temperature parties and is listed in Appendix II of decision XXVIII/2, please use data form 8 to report quantities of HFC produced for use in approved subsectors as listed in appendix I to the decision. 
		</p>
		<p>
			That production must be for use within your country and not for export. In case other subsectors are approved after the assessments under paragraphs 32 and 33 of decision XXVIII/2, please use the additional columns in the data form to specify the approved subsectors and the amounts produced for use in those subsectors.
