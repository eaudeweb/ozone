		<h1>Instructions on data on consumption (imports) under the exemption for high-ambient-temperature parties (data form 7)</h1>

		<p>
			If your country formally notified the Secretariat, as specified under paragraph 29 of decision XXVIII/2, of its intention to use the exemption for high-ambient-temperature parties and is listed in Appendix II of decision XXVIII/2, please use data form 7 to report quantities of new HFCs imported for use in approved subsectors as listed in appendix I to the decision. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Those imports must be for use within your country and not for export. In case other subsectors are approved after the assessments under paragraphs 32 and 33 of decision XXVIII/2, please use the additional columns in the data form to specify the approved subsectors and the amounts imported for use in those subsectors. 
		</p>
		<p>
				Only bulk gases for servicing of equipment in the exempted subsectors should be reported here, not gases imported inside pre-charged equipment.
