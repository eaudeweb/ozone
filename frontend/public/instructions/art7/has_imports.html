		<h1>Instructions on data on imports of controlled substances (data form 1)</h1>

		<p>1. Please use data form 1 to report data on imports of substances listed in Annex A (CFCs and halons), Annex B (other fully halogenated CFCs, methyl chloroform and carbon tetrachloride), Annex C (HCFCs, HBFCs and BCM), Annex E (methyl bromide) and Annex F (HFCs).
		</p>

		<p>2. All the substances in Annex A, Annex B (Groups II and III) and Annex F are listed in column 2 of data form 1. For Annex B Group I (other fully halogenated CFCs) and Annex C Group I (HCFCs), only substances that have been reported by parties in the past are listed. HBFCs and BCM were phased out by all parties immediately upon inclusion in the list of controlled substance, and hence for HBFCs and BCM one blank row has been provided as a formality only.

		If you are importing controlled substances other than those listed, please use the blank space to report data on those substances, and use additional pages, if necessary.
		</p>

		<p>3. If your country imported mixtures of controlled substances, e.g., R-410A (50% HFC-32; 50% HFC-125), you may choose to report either the quantity of the mixture or the individual constituents of the mixture. If you choose to report mixtures rather than their individual constituents, please take care to ensure that the quantities reported are those of the mixtures, not their individual constituents. The Secretariat will calculate the quantity of the individual pure controlled substances contained in the mixture and enter the appropriate data under each controlled substance. An illustrative list of mixtures with their compositions is given in section 11 of these data reporting instructions and guidelines. If the mixture being reported is not included in section 11, please indicate the percentage by weight of each constituent controlled substance of the mixture being reported. For further information about the composition and commercial trade names of chemical products containing controlled substances, visit the “Trade names of chemicals containing ozone-depleting substances and their alternatives” page on the OzonAction website.2 This worldwide database service is designed to help customs officials and national ozone units control imports and exports of controlled substances and prevent their illegal trade.
		</p>

		<p>4. Please enter the number of tonnes imported in column 3 of data form 1 for each substance imported. If you did not import any of the substances listed, or if you have imported only recovered or reclaimed substances, please enter a zero in column 3, “New”, for each substance. If you imported any recovered or reclaimed substances, please enter the data in column 4.
		</p>

		<p>5. When calculating a party's consumption, substances used as feedstock for the production of other chemicals are exempted, as such substances are completely transformed in the manufacturing process of the new chemical. In reporting total quantities of new substances imported in column 3, do not deduct the quantities imported for feedstock reported in column 5. Similarly, do not deduct the quantities imported for exempted essential, critical, high-ambient-temperature or other uses reported in column 6. The Secretariat will make the necessary deductions. In column 7, please indicate, for each type of controlled substance imported for exempted essential, critical, high-ambient-temperature or other uses, the decision of the Meeting of the Parties that approved the use. Should the column space be insufficient, further information can be provided in the “comments” box at the bottom of the form.
		</p>

		<p>6. When calculating a party's consumption of methyl bromide, the quantities used for quarantine and pre-shipment applications are excluded. In data form 1, please enter the quantities of methyl bromide imported for quarantine and pre-shipment applications separately at the bottom of the form, and do not deduct them from the total quantity imported. The Secretariat will make the necessary deductions.
		</p>

		<p>7. Decision XXIV/12, paragraph 1, requested the Secretariat to revise the reporting forms resulting from decision XVII/16 to include an annex indicating the exporting party for the quantities reported as imports, noting that the annex is excluded from the reporting requirements under Article 7 of the Protocol, and that the information in the annex would be provided on a voluntary basis. If a particular controlled substance is imported from more than one country, please indicate the quantity imported from each country separately.
