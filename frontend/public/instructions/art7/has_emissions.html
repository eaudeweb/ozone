		<h1>Instructions on data on emissions of Annex F, Group II substance â€“ HFC-23 (data form 6)</h1>

		<p>1. Very few countries will have manufacturing facilities for Annex C Group I or Annex F substances that generate HFC-23. If your country has such facilities that were operational in the reporting period, please use data form 6 to report emissions of HFC-23 from each facility. If there were no emissions from a manufacturing facility, please include the facility in the data form and enter a zero in the emissions column.
		</p>

		<p>2. The amounts of production or generated HFC-23 that is captured for use, feedstock, destruction or storage shall be reported in data form 3 on production. The amounts converted to other substances shall be reported as feedstock uses in data form 3. The amounts destroyed shall be reported in data form 4, except the amounts of HFC-23 that are destroyed without prior capture.
		</p>

		<p>3. The information in columns 2 to 5 of data form 6 is excluded from the reporting requirements under Article 7 the Protocol and is provided on a voluntary basis The amount of generated HFC-23 refers to the total amount whether captured or not. The sum of the amounts of total generated HFC-23 is not to be reported under data form 3. However, the sums of the amounts of generated HFC-23 that are captured are to be reported under data form 3 under the corresponding columns. Column 4 in data form 6 refers to the amounts converted to other substances in the specified facilities, and the sum of those amounts is not to be reported under data form 3. Column 5 in data form 6 refers to amounts destroyed in the specified facilities.
