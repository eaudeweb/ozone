		<h1>Instructions on data on production of controlled substances (data form 3)</h1>

		<p>1. Please use data form 3 to report data on production of substances listed in Annex A (CFCs and halons), Annex B (other fully halogenated CFCs, methyl chloroform and carbon tetrachloride), Annex C (HCFCs, HBFCs and BCM), Annex E (methyl bromide) and Annex F (HFCs). Generation of HFC-23 that is captured, whether for destruction, feedstock or any other use, shall be reported in data form 3.
		</p>

		<p>2. All the substances in Annex A, Annex B Groups II and III, and Annex F are listed in column 2 of data form 3. For Annex B Group I (other fully halogenated CFCs) and Annex C Group I (HCFCs), only substances that have been reported by parties in the past are listed. HBFCs and BCM have already been phased out by all parties and hence one row has been provided as a formality only. If you are producing controlled substances other than those listed, please use the blank space to report data on those substances, or use additional pages, if necessary.
		</p>

		<p>3. In column 3 of data form 3, please give the total production or generation of HFC-23 of your country without making any deductions for feedstock, destruction, export for feedstock uses, or any other use. Do not deduct from your total production or generation of HFC-23 that is captured the quantity of production used for feedstock within your country reported in column 4, or the production for exempted essential, critical, high-ambient-temperature or other uses within your country reported in column 5. Similarly, do not deduct from your total production the quantity of production for supply to Article 5 parties reported in column 7. Please report exports of controlled substances to be used for feedstock by the importing country in column 5 of data form 2 (data on exports), not in data form 3 (this form). The Secretariat will make the necessary deductions. With regard to production for exempted essential, critical, high-ambient-temperature or other uses, please indicate in column 6, for each type of controlled substance produced for exempted essential, critical, high-ambient-temperature or other uses, the decision of the Meeting of the Parties that approved the use. Should the column space be insufficient, further information can be provided in the “comments” box at the end of the form.
		</p>

		<p>4. When calculating a party's consumption, the Montreal Protocol does not include controlled substances used as feedstock for the production of other chemicals, as such controlled substances are completely transformed in the manufacturing process of the new chemical. If your country produced or generated controlled substances for feedstock use within the reporting period, please provide data on the quantity of each controlled substance produced for feedstock purposes in column 4. The Secretariat will make the necessary deductions. Generated HFC-23 that is captured, whether for destruction, feedstock or any other use, shall be reported on data form 3. Amounts converted to other substances shall be reported under the column for feedstock uses. Amounts of HFC-23 captured for destruction or feedstock use will not be counted as production as per Article 1.
		</p>

		<p>5. Producers are allowed to produce additional amounts to meet the basic domestic needs of Article 5 parties. If your country produced controlled substances for this purpose, please enter the amount so produced in column 7 of data form 3.
		</p>

		<p>6. When calculating a party's consumption of methyl bromide, quantities produced for quarantine and pre-shipment applications are exempted. Please enter the total quantities of methyl bromide produced for quarantine and pre-shipment applications separately at the bottom of data form 3 and do not deduct them from the total quantity produced. The Secretariat will make the necessary deductions.
