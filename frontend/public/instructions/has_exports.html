		<h1>Instructions on data on exports of controlled substances (data form 2)</h1>

		<p>1. Please use data form 1 to report data on imports of substances listed in Annex A (CFCs and halons), Annex B (other fully halogenated CFCs, methyl chloroform and carbon tetrachloride), Annex C (HCFCs, HBFCs and BCM), Annex E (methyl bromide) and Annex F (HFCs).
		</p>

		<p>2. Data on re-exports of the substances listed above should also be included in this form. Decision IV/14 clarified that cases of import and re-export should be treated as two separate transactions, so that the country of intermediate destination would report both the import from the country of origin and re-export to the country of final destination.
		</p>

		<p>3. The first column (“Substance”) has been left blank because each party may export different substances. Please add the names and relevant information of only those substances being exported by your country.
		</p>

		<p>4. If your country exported mixtures of controlled substances, e.g., R-410A (50% HFC-32; 50% HFC-125), you may choose to report either the quantity of the mixture, or the individual constituents of the mixture. If you choose to report mixtures rather than their individual constituents, please take care to ensure that quantities reported are those of the mixtures, not their individual constituents. The Secretariat will calculate the quantity of the individual pure controlled substances contained in the mixture and enter the appropriate data under each controlled substance. An illustrative list of mixtures with their compositions is given in section 11 of these data reporting instructions and guidelines. If the mixture being reported is not included in section 11, please indicate the percentage by weight of each constituent controlled substance of the mixture being reported. For further information about the composition and commercial trade names of chemical products containing controlled substances, visit the “Trade names of chemicals containing ozone-depleting substances and their alternatives” on the OzonAction website.3 This worldwide database service is designed to help customs officials and national ozone units control imports and exports of controlled substances and prevent illegal trade.
		</p>

		<p>4. Reporting of countries of destination is not a requirement under Article 7. In paragraph 4 of decision VII/9, it is stated that parties should report on the destination of Annex A and Annex B substances (new, recovered or reclaimed) that are exported. Paragraph 4 of decision XVII/16 requested a revision of the reporting formats to cover the export of all controlled substances contained in the annexes of the Protocol and urged parties to implement the revised reporting format expeditiously. Please fill in column 2 on the destination of exports, ensuring that if a particular controlled substance is exported to more than one country, the quantity exported to each country is indicated separately.
