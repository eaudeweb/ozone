		<h1>Instructions on data on imports from and exports to non-parties (data form 5)</h1>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Please use data form 5 to report data on imports from and exports to non-parties of substances of Annex A (CFCs and halons), Annex B (other fully halogenated CFCs, methyl chloroform and carbon tetrachloride), Annex C (HCFCs, HBFCs and BCM) and Annex E (methyl bromide).
			</li>
			<li>
				The first column (“Substance”) has been left blank because each party may import different substances or mixtures from and/or export different substances or mixtures to non-parties. Please fill in only the names of those substances that were imported from and/or exported to non-parties.
			</li>
			<li>
				For purposes of these data forms, “non-party” means:
				<ul>
					<li>
						With respect to Annex A substances, all countries that have not ratified the 1987 Montreal Protocol;
					</li>
					<li>
						With respect to Annex B substances, all countries that have not ratified the London Amendment;
					</li>
					<li>
						With respect to Annex C substances, all countries that have not ratified the Copenhagen Amendment;
					</li>
					<li>
						With respect to Annex E substances, all countries that have not ratified the Copenhagen Amendment;
					</li>
				</ul>
				except where the parties have otherwise specified by means of a decision.
			</li>
			<li>
				Exports of HFCs should not be reported under data form 5 but should be reported under data form 2. Any export of HFCs that is nonetheless reported on data form 5 shall not be treated as export to non-parties for the purpose of calculating the consumption levels as specified in paragraph 1 (c) of Article 3 of the Montreal Protocol.
			</li>
			<li>
				Reporting of information on “exporting parties for quantities reported as imports” and “countries of destination of exports” is not a requirement under Article 7 of the Protocol, and the information is to be provided on a voluntary basis. Please fill in column 2 on the exporting countries for imports or destination of exports, ensuring that if a particular controlled substance is exported to or imported from more than one country, the quantity exported to or imported from each country is indicated separately.
			</li>
			<li>
				The status of ratification of the Montreal Protocol and its amendments can be found in a document published by the Secretariat and updated twice a year. That information is also available on the website of the Ozone Secretariat, at: <a	href="http://ozone.unep.org/">http://ozone.unep.org/</a>.
