		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>1. The attached data forms have been designed to make reporting easier for the parties. The reporting is prescribed by Article 7 of the Montreal Protocol and further described in various decisions of the Meeting of the Parties. Some decisions introduce additional items that parties may report voluntarily.</p>
		<p>2. The data reported in accordance with the data forms will be used to determine the calculated levels of production and consumption, upon which the control measures are based.</p>
		<p>The major features of the forms are as follows:
			<ol>
				<li>Six separate data forms are provided for imports, exports, production, destruction, trade with non-parties and emissions of controlled substances. Please use only those data forms applicable to your country and ignore the other forms, after ticking off the respective “No” box in the questionnaire. For example, many parties only import and do not export, produce, destroy or trade with non-parties in any of the substances. If this is the case, please use only data form 1 on imports and ignore the other forms, after ticking off the “No” boxes for questions 1.2 – 1.6 on the questionnaire.
				</li>
				<li>
					A row has been provided in data forms 1 (imports) and 3 (production) for each of the substances in Annex A, Annex B Groups II and III, Annex E and Annex F. However, for categories of “Other CFCs” (Annex B Group I) and HCFCs (Annex C Group I), the form is made shorter by providing rows only for substances commonly reported by parties in the past. A few blank rows are provided for more substances, if needed. HBFCs and BCM (Annex C Groups II and III) were phased out by all parties immediately upon inclusion in the list of controlled substance; hence, one blank row has been provided for them as a formality only. You may use the computerized forms supplied by the Secretariat or paper forms. Parties who use the computerized forms can easily add more rows as needed; parties using paper forms are free to add pages as required.
