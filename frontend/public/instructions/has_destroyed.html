		<h1>Instructions on data on destruction of controlled substances (data form 4)</h1>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Very few countries have the capacity to destroy controlled substances using approved destruction technologies. If your country has destroyed any of the substances listed in Annex A (CFCs and halons), Annex B (other fully halogenated CFCs, methyl chloroform and carbon tetrachloride), Annex C (HCFCs, HBFCs and BCM), Annex E (methyl bromide) and Annex F (HFCs) in the reporting period, please use data form 4.
			</li>
			<li>
				The first column (“Substance”) has been left blank because each party may destroy different substances or mixtures. Please list only the names of those substances or mixtures destroyed in the reporting year.
			</li>
			<li>
				Under the Montreal Protocol, the amount of substances destroyed is not included in the calculation of a party’s production and consumption if destruction occurred through the use of an approved technology (listed in decision XXIII/12 and any subsequent relevant decisions). If you have destroyed any substance in the reporting year, do not deduct the quantity destroyed reported in column 2 of data form 4 from the total production reported in column 3 of data form 3. The Secretariat will make the necessary deductions. HFC-23 amounts destroyed without prior capture will not be counted in the calculation of production.
